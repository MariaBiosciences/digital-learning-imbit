# Digital-Learning-IMBIT

This project is part of the study program "International Management for Business and IT". It integrates a learning platform about this study program and digital learning in general, but also two Serious Games and a Mediawiki about Cloud Computing.

## Description

The learning platform consists of four distinct parts:
* brillianIDEAS
* brillianCRM
* brillianICM
* Mediawiki


## Getting Started

As part of the project, the backend/ infrastructure team provides a documentation about several relevant aspects as for example how to install all necessary tools on your lokal machine and how to prepare the webserver for deployment.
